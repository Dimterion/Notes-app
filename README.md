# Notes App

An application to create notes of various types and store them under the users accounts.

## Details

The app allows users to create accounts, write notes, view their notes details, set their statuses, post updates and mark them as complete.

This application is built using MERN-stack and deployed on [Railway](https://notes-app-production-3eb2.up.railway.app/). There is also an alternative link for [Render](https://notes-app-mbwb.onrender.com/) which can take some time to load.

Both back and front-end have been written for this app, and all its code is stored in this repo.

The app may change in the future as it's currently in Work In Progress state (it also means that any saved data may be deleted from it).

## Built with

React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, CSS, Prettier
