# Notes App

An application to create notes of various types and store them under the user's account.

## Details

The app allows users to create accounts, write notes, view their details, set their status, post updates and mark them as complete.

This application is built using MERN-stack and deployed on [Railway](https://notes-app-production-3eb2.up.railway.app/). There is also an alternative link for [Render] (https://notes-app-mbwb.onrender.com/).

Both back and front-end have been built for this app and are stored in this repo.

The app may change in the future as it's currently in Work In Progress state (that also means any saved data may be deleted from it).

## Built with

React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, CSS, Prettier
